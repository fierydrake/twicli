Twicli is a very simple user twitter home page monitor for the command line.

It expects a simple text file called "credentials" in the current working
directory on startup.  This file should contain 2 lines, the first containing
your twitter userid and the second your password.

Run Twicli as follows:
  ruby twicli.rb

It should display a current time divider any time it sees new tweets, and
it will print those tweets out each with their own timestamp (in localtime)
and username.  It tries to align usernames and tweet text for easy reading.

Every time it checks for new tweets (default is 60 seconds, you can change
this in the source easily) and none are found, it prints the current time
(which will be overwritten in the next update so as not to leave lots of
meaningless timestamps all over your terminal). 

Required gems:
  xml-simple

That's about it.
